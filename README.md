# HOW TO INSTALL 

Go to your Tera Directory which should either be 

STEAM:  C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Tera
STANDALONE:  C:\Users\Public\Games\En Masse Entertainment\TERA

Now go to \Client\S1Game and create a folder called _S1Game /you can theoretically name it _mods too)
Move the file there and done!
